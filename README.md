# MotorFaultDetection

The Motor Fault Detection Project focuses on analyzing motor performance data to detect potential faults and classify motor conditions using advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques. Our approach emphasizes a comprehensive workflow that includes data collection, preprocessing, domain analysis, and model development to ensure reliable fault diagnosis.
Phases of the project is given below : 
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Time-Domain Analysis
3. Frequency-Domain Analysis
4. Machine Learning & Feature Extraction
5. Validation and Testing
